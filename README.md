## Project Status

This project is in alpha. Many of the components from AeroThemePlasma are installed but not configured. Some components are not installed at all. There are many rough edges.

## Installation

1. Install [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) using their ISO.
2. Rebase to one of the Winblues 7 images:

**For NVIDIA**
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/winblues/blue7-nvidia:latest
``` 

**For Intel/AMD**
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/winblues/blue7:latest
```
